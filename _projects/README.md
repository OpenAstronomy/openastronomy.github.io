# How to add project ideas for OpenAstronomy

This short tutorial will guide you on how to add a GSoC project idea in the
OpenAstronomy website.

In case you face any issues with this tutorial do contact your org admins via email,
[Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#openastronomy:matrix.org),
or in the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openastronomy).

*tl;dr: are you an expert?* Fork the repo and modify
the [template file](./_template.md) according to your idea, save it under
`_projects/YYYY/sub-org/` with a meaningful filename and open a pull-request.

## What do I need for my project idea?

Everything you need is a title and description of the project idea, a set of requirements
for potential students (_e.g._, proficiency with `astropy.tables` and `astropy.units`),
and a list of potential mentors. In addition, please link any related issues or tickets
to the project idea, if any. Lastly, make sure to indicate the level of difficulty of
the project. 

In case your project idea already has specific milestones, please add them
so as to make students aware when they start writing their applications.
If the project milestones are open ended and you would like to hear input from
other members of the community, that is fine too!

## Required format

Given that you have the above items, all you need now is to put them in a plain text file following
the [template file](./_template.md) (you may click on `RAW` to see how it looks).

The file is composed in two parts (separated by a `---`).
Change the text in the template keeping special care of the structure of the `yaml`
file and the headings on the markdown part (_e.g._, the top level starts with a 4 level title: `####`).

## How to include my project idea on the website?

If you are familiar with git/GitHub: for this repo and add your project idea
to the directory of your sub-organisation. Otherwise, we've got you covered!
Contact us via [email](openastronomy.organization@gmail.com) and attach the above file.
