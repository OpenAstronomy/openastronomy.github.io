#### Description

The coordinates subpackage currently only supports transforming positional coordinates, but it would be useful to develop a consistent framework for also transforming velocities (e.g., proper motion to proper motion, or proper motion to cartesian) with full support for barycentric, galactocentric, and LSR motion. This project could be:

1. working with us to develop a consistent API for handling velocities within coordinates
2. developing a trial implementation of an API
3. actually doing core development to implement the new features
4. some combination of all of the above.
