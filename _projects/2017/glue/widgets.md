#### Description

This project is to develop new widgets/dialogs inside glue. Examples include:

* A dialog that would be useful beyond this project is a dialog for importing
  ASCII tables into glue, similar to the CSV import functionality in e.g.
  OpenOffice/LibreOffice or Excel.

* A dialog that allows the user to edit components of a datasets, including
  renaming them, sorting them, and changing datatypes.

* A dialog that can be used to re-order categorical components

* A dialog to visually create simple selections (for example that a specific
  component should be in a certain range)
