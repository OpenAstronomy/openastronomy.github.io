#### Description

Julia is a growing language for numerical computing and is very conducive to astronomical image processing. JuliaAstro is a community working on providing common tools and utilities for astronomers in Julia. One piece of missing functionality in JuliaAstro is astronomical data reduction methods. Previous tools like IRAF and IDL libraries have been deprecated and represent a previous era of computation. This project is to build a Julia package under the JuliaAstro organization that provides functionality similar to available packages in other languages (e.g. [`ccdproc`](https://ccdproc.readthedocs.io/)).

#### Milestones (if any)
