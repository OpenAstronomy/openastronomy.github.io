#### Description

There have been various proposals for adding image processing and manipulation code to the SunPy library.
SunPy has decided that this functionality will instead reside in an affiliated package, named [sunkit-image.](https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-image/)
This project will implement the initial functionality with a broad scope.

We have a range of open issues that form the starting core of the project and contain more concreate steps and information about each feature request.

This project should achieve most or all of the following goals (roughly in this order):

1. Implement the [normalizing-radial-graded filter (NRGF)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006SoPh..236..263M).
2. Port the Multi-Scale Gaussian Normalisation (MGN) code from [#1899](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1899).
3. Implement the [OCCULT-2 algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5046) for coronal loop tracing.
4. Implement the [soft morphological filtering of solar images](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2006/38/aa4852-06.pdf)

There are more complex features we would like but will only be looked at once the previous features have been implemented.

5. Refactor and write a Python wrapper for [FLCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.4289) [code](http://solarmuri.ssl.berkeley.edu/overview/publicdownloads/software.html).
6. Implement image alignment using feature detection and tracking. [Example](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_brief.html)
7. Implement image re-sampling as described [here](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/B:SOLA.0000021743.24248.b0.pdf) through updating [this pull request](https://github.com/astropy/reproject/pull/52) to the Astropy [image resampling](https://reproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) repository.

#### Milestones
