Improving astropy Table performance

#### Description

The astropy table sub-package defines a core Table class that is
used to store and manipulate tabular data within astropy.  This class
was written with an emphasis on functionality, convenience for astronomers,
and code clarity.  With the astropy table package now fairly mature
and with a strong set of regression tests in place, it is time to focus
on performance for basic operations like table creation and slicing.
For a simple operation like slicing, astropy Table is currently about
a factor of 10 slower than Pandas.  This project will focus on identifying
performance bottlenecks, writing performance tests for astropy-benchmarks,
and then developing code to improve the performance.  It is possible that
some fixes will require the use of Cython so previous experience is
desirable though not absolutely required.

#### Milestones (if any)

##### GSOC 2019 CODING STARTS

* Perform developer install of `astropy`.
* Install Python profiling tools.
* Study astropy and the table package capabilities.

##### GSOC 2019 MIDTERM

* Install and run `asv`.
* Examine existing `asv` benchmarks and identify areas for improved benchmarking.
* Profile key parts of table code and identify performance bottlenecks.
* Identify strategies for improved speed performance.
* Implement initial performance improvements.

##### GSOC 2019 FINAL

* Continue and finalize implementation of performance improvements.
* Contine and finalize additional `asv` benchmark tests.
