# Description

In partnership with the NASA Science Platform Initiative, which promotes scientific
research by providing enhanced access to archival data on the cloud, this project
aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for the generation, augmentation, and
enhancement of archival astronomical data. Addressing the challenge of data diversity,
including variations in temporal spans, wavelength coverages, resolutions, and depth,
we plan to integrate advanced data processing techniques with deep learning models
such as flow-based architectures and transformers. Our objective is to rectify data
gaps and inconsistencies within astronomical datasets, facilitating uniform analysis
and minimizing information loss.

This initiative seeks to significantly enhance the
utility of existing astronomical datasets, ensuring that even incomplete data can
contribute meaningfully to scientific advancements. A crucial part of our methodology
involves the development and testing of a data unification schema on large samples
of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), serving as a robust testbed for our algorithms.


This effort will not only validate the algorithms' ability to address complex data
challenges but also highlight their applicability across astronomical research.


## Goals

* Design and optimize a deep learning architecture tailored for the enhancement and unification of astronomical archival data.
* Conduct comprehensive testing of the data unification schema on large samples of AGNs
