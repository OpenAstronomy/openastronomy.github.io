#### Description

The increasing number of X-ray telescopes observing accreting black hole sources 
has led to an incredibly large amount of available observational data. 
To build a comprehensive understanding of stellar-mass black hole phenomenology, 
it is essential to access and analyze this information in an intuitive and structured manner.
This project aims at developing a tool that analyzes, stores, and organizes 
key data products of multiple observations in a database. Users will be able to interactively explore 
the database and classify individual observations based on data products 
retrieved with Stingray, potentially leveraging innovative machine learning techniques. 
Beyond enabling large-scale classification and the discovery of general trends 
in accreting black hole binaries, the tool will allow astronomers to identify 
peculiar features hidden within the vast dataset.

Challenges: Efficient storage and fast retrieval of data products, 
ensuring interactivity of the tool, and enabling comparisons across different X-ray instruments.

#### Milestones (if any)
- gain familiarity with the observations (different type of X-ray telescopes) and with the products
- create the database
- graphic interface to interact with the database
- classification of the observations base on their products (possible use of ML techniques)
