#### Description

This is a code performance project for
[Stingray](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray) with the aim of
handling large datasets (more than 1 million photons) that do not fit into
memory (such as from [AstroSat](http://astrosat.iucaa.in/?q=node/12) and
[NICER](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/)). The student will
go through GitHub issues to see where Stingray workflows are breaking down in
practical use cases, make a thorough profiling of the code, single out
bottlenecks, and find solutions.

#### Deliverables
Deliverables for this project will be profiling and developing solutions for
code bottlenecks and other hindrances to using Stingray library tools on large
datasets.

##### To complete each milestone

+ Working unit tests for each piece of code

+ Documentation for each class, method and function implemented
