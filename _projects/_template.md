Particularly beneficial for extra-galactical astronomers interested in a user friendly enviorment to view and fit models galaxy cluster data ranging from celestial coordinates and redshift to x-ray surface brightness.

#### Description
Galaxt Cluster Data Visualization and Fitting was conceived after countless hours were spent hardcoding plotting and fitting functions to SDSS data. Initially written as a headless program that can plot and fit any function to galaxy cluster data using least squares, the latest version has become a much more visual tool for plotting and fitting of 
.
