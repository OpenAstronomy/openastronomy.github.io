OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics
projects to share resources, ideas, and to improve code.


## Get involved with OpenAstronomy

If you want to get involved with OpenAstronomy or maybe you have a project that
would like to join the collaboration, please feel free to get in touch. The
OpenAstronomy organisation has a mailing list (<a

which is good place to introduce yourself.

You can also get involved by joining our chat using either:
Matrix

IRC (<a href="{{ site.irc_freenode }}#{{site.irc_channel }}">#openastronomy
on freenode.net</a>), [gitter](https://gitter.im/OpenAstronomy/Lobby) or [slack](https://openastronomy.slack.com) which regularly has a number of people in it, if you want
to pop in for an astronomy related conversation.
