## GSoC & Open Astronomy 2025

OpenAstronomy is an umbrella organisation which collects project ideas from any of its members.
OpenAstronomy has been a GSOC mentoring organisation since 2016 and it's applying to participate in 2025.

Contributors applications to OpenAstronomy projects follows the same rules as the [Python Software Foundation] and the [GSoC Contributor Guide].
We have [also our own guide to a good application for OpenAstronomy][OpenAstronomy Contributor Guide].

All student blogs are collected on the [OpenAstronomy Universe] site.
