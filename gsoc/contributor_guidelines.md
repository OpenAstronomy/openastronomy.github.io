# GSoC Contributor Application Guidelines

**Communication Channels**

OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects and as such, to get help you need to find the specific project you are interested in:

1.  Browse the **[Project Ideas Page](/gsoc/)** to find a project that interests you.
2.  Check the **[Members Page](/members)** to find the chat links for that specific organization.
3.  Join *that* organization's chat to talk to the mentors!

If you want to apply to OpenAstronomy to participate in GSoC
there are many things you can do to improve your application.
Many of OpenAstronomy's admins and mentors have participated in
previous editions of GSoC with their projects, so will be able to
answer any questions you might have, come talk to us on the
mailing list.

There are many guidelines on writing a good application and how to
increase your chances, this guide covers the most important things
to OpenAstronomy, however, you should also checkout the [GSoC Contributor
Guide], the [Python Software Foundation] guide, the [Astropy GSoC guidelines] and the [SymPy
Guidelines] to name but a few.

Some general pointers to follow are:


1. **The better we know you, the better we can judge your application.**
There are many ways to get yourself known by the community, you can introduce yourself through the
OpenAstronomy mailing list ([how to use Google Groups](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/1046523?hl=en)), chat with us in the Matrix channel ([how to connect to matrix](https://element.io/user-guide)) and if required contact the mentors to know
more about certain project. However, contacting mentors through email or direct messages is discouraged, and contacting them in public channels is the preferred way to provide answers to multiple people at once. Also, when you have a particular idea in
mind, get in touch with that project and introduce yourself.
For `astropy` projects you can do this by sending an e-mail to the
[astropy-gsoc-applications](<mailto:astropy-gsoc-applications@googlegroups.com>) mailing list
(please do not send to the `astropy-dev` list).

2. **Become a user!**
Download one or more of the OpenAstronomy projects and start experimenting with the code.
Look at the [latest pictures of the million degree Sun] with [SunPy](http://sunpy.org/),
[volume render a simulation of the galaxy] with [yt](http://yt-project.org/), or
[plan some astronomical observations] with [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) - There
are loads of things to do with all the projects involved with OpenAstronomy,
get involved!

3. **Set yourself up as a developer.**
Create an account on [GitHub](http://github.com) or the forge the organisation is using.
Don't know how to use [git](http://www.git-scm.com/) or [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)?
Don't worry, there are lots of git [tutorials](http://try.github.com) [online](http://gitimmersion.com/)
and many [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Tutorial) [ones](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/)
[as well](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) that will help you to get quite confident with it in a short time.
Also both the [Astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index_dev.html)
and [yt](http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/developing/developing.html)
developer guides are great reads no matter what project you are thinking of working on.
Have you got stuck? ask on the forum or chat rooms for help and volunteers will support you.

4. **Start to be a developer.**
Checkout the issue lists of the projects to see if there is something that you could do.
**You will be expected to submit a pull request to one of the OpenAstronomy projects before
you submit your application (it does not have to be accepted, but it has to be something
that shows your code abilities!).** This requirement is to show that you know how git, github,
pull requests and reviews work and allows mentors to eveluate all applications based on a real code
contribution, instead of e.g. the name of a specific school.
GSOC is a short program and we want to make sure you are
ready to start immediately. If you have previously contributed to OpenAstronomy projects,
you can point to those pull requests, too.

5. **Plan your application.**
Think which is your favourite project from the [ideas page](/gsoc/).
Prepare a plan on how you will tackle that project and the time it will take you to solve it.
Do not worry much in providing exact dates, but plan it as best as you can
(if you are planing to have some holidays during the GSoC programme, then you should mention it too).
Use [our application template][gsoc-proposal-template] to describe how you plan to do the work during the programme.
Add your draft to the [gsoc-proposals](https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/gsoc-proposals) repository. This will be place where to receive any feedback. Follow the indications mentioned in that repository to submit your proposal.
Also, don't be afraid to ask your potential mentors for help.
Don't be shy when describing yourself!

6. **Submit your application.**
Besides adding your proposal to the gsoc-proposals repository, you also need to [submit your application](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) before the deadline. Please, include the sub-org name at the start of your proposal title as: `[<sub-org>] <project name>`, where `<suborg>` should be the name of the sub-org in lower case (e.g., `sunpy`, `stingray`, `radis`), or the combination of two if it's the case (e.g., `astropy|sunpy`).
Only the proposals present on both, the gsoc-proposals repository and GSoC platform, will be considered.

7. **Respect the AI policies.**
Much of the [Open Source ecosystem is suffering due to AI Slop][ai-slop-summary]. Don't be one adding more pain to this, doing so will result on being banned of the whole organisation. This is not to say that you can't use AI tools to support your learning, you can, but keeping in mind the policies and rules that each suborg may have. As a starting point, if you don't find an AI contribution policy or rules related the use of LLMs, assume they are forbidden.
