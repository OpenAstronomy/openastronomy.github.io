# GSoC Student Application Guidelines

If you want to apply to OpenAstronomy to participate in GSoC
there are many things you can do to improve your application.
Many of OpenAstronomy's admins and mentors have participated in
previous editions of GSoC with their projects, so will be able to
answer any questions you might have, come talk to us on [Matrix] or the
mailing list.

There are many guidelines on writing a good application and how to
increase your chances, this guide covers the most important things
to OpenAstronomy, however, you should also checkout the [GSoC Student
Guide], the [Python Software Foundation] guide, the [Astropy GSoC guidelines] and the [SymPy
Guidelines] to name but a few.

Some general pointers to follow are:


1. **The better we know you, the better we can judge your application.**
There are many ways to get yourself known by the community, you can introduce yourself through the
OpenAstronomy mailing list, chat with us in the Matrix channel and even contact the mentors to know
more about certain project. Also, when you have a particular idea in
mind, get in touch with that project and introduce yourself.
For `astropy` projects you can do this by sending an e-mail to the
[astropy-gsoc-applications](<mailto:astropy-gsoc-applications@googlegroups.com>) mailing list
(please do not send to the `astropy-dev` list).

2. **Become a user!**
Download one or more of the OpenAstronomy projects and start experimenting with the code.
Look at the [latest pictures of the million degree Sun] with [SunPy](http://sunpy.org/),
[volume render a simulation of the galaxy] with [yt](http://yt-project.org/), or
[plan some astronomical observations] with [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) - There
are loads of things to do with all the projects involved with OpenAstronomy,
get involved!

3. **Set yourself up as a developer.**
Create an account on [GitHub](http://github.com) or [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org).
Don't know how to use [git](http://www.git-scm.com/) or [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)?
Don't worry, it's easy and there are lots of git [tutorials](http://try.github.com) [online](http://gitimmersion.com/)
and many [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Tutorial) [ones](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/)
[as well](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) that will help you to get quite confident with it in a short time.
Also both the [Astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html#developer-documentation)
and [yt](http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/developing/developing.html)
developer guides are great reads no matter what project you are thinking of working on.

4. **Start to be a developer.**
Checkout the issue lists of the projects to see if there is something that you could do.
**You will be expected to submit a pull request to one of the OpenAstronomy projects before
you submit your application (it does not have to be accepted, but it has to be something
that shows your code abilities!).**

5. **Plan your application.**
Think which is your favourite project from the [ideas page](/gsoc/) or think
of a new one that will help out one of the OpenAstronomy members.
Prepare a plan on how you will tackle that project and the time it will take you to solve it.
Do not worry much in providing exact dates, but plan it as best as you can
(if you are planing to have some holidays during the GSoC programme, then you should mention it too).
Also, don't be afraid to ask your potential mentor for help.
Don't be shy when describing yourself!

6. **Submit your application.**
Don't forget to [submit your application](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) before the deadline.
We are also happy to give comments on your proposal if you like.  Feel free to
add your application to the sub-org member's wiki following this format: "GSoC-\<YEAR\> Application \<sub-org\> \<Your Name\>:\<Project Name\>"
and link such page in [the wiki](https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/openastronomy/wiki).
