<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>RADIS app is a web application for Radis high-resolution infrared molecular spectra.
Instead of writing code, this project aims to create an intuitive user interface (UI).
It use radis internally to produce spectrum, and the updated version and radis algorithm make it incredibly efficient to compute the millions of lines in only a few minutes.
Radis app leverages React 18 to offer the user interface, and FastApi on the backend.</p>

<p>We are using react-hook-form for the fastest user experience and to maintain performance on the client slide.
In the backend, we use FastApi to offer the fastest response.
We created this app with the intention of giving both researchers and non-researchers access to the most valuable elements of Radis via a straightforward online application.
Our team and contributors are always trying to make the app better.
The app has additional features and capabilities in newer versions.</p>

<p>Our project is all about enhancing user experience to the next level!
Weâ€™re committed to bringing you cutting-edge features and fine-tuning these features for maximum performance and efficiency, and rigorous testing to ensure they meet the needs of our highly valued end users.</p>
