<h1 id="interactive-database-for-x-ray-observations">Interactive Database for X-ray observations</h1>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>The increasing number of X-ray telescopes observing accreting black hole sources 
has led to an incredibly large amount of available observational data. 
To build a comprehensive understanding of stellar-mass black hole phenomenology, 
it is essential to access and analyze this information in an intuitive and structured manner.</p>

<p>This project aims at developing a tool that analyzes, stores, and organizes 
key data products of multiple observations in a database. Users will be able to interactively explore 
the database and classify individual observations based on data products 
retrieved with Stingray, potentially leveraging innovative machine learning techniques. 
Beyond enabling large-scale classification and the discovery of general trends 
in accreting black hole binaries, the tool will allow astronomers to identify 
peculiar features hidden within the vast dataset.</p>

<p>Challenges: Efficient storage and fast retrieval of data products, 
ensuring interactivity of the tool, and enabling comparisons across different X-ray instruments.</p>
