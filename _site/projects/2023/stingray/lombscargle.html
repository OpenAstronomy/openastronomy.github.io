<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Stingray provides methods for analysing astronomical time series, in particular data from space telescopes observing some of the most extreme sources in the universe: violent stellar explosions, matter falling into black holes, and rapidly spinning neutron stars. So far, stingray has focused almost entirely on methods in the Fourier domain, which we understand well, but come with a significant drawback: they require data to be observed at evenly spaced intervals. However, for many reasons, our data might not be evenly sampled, for example, when the satellite is behind the earth. In this project, we will implement a range of time series methods and spectral-timing methods, starting with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, to work in stingray, in order to enable a wider range of astronomical studies.</p>
