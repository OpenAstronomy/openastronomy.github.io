<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Stingray provides methods for analysing astronomical time series, 
in particular data from space telescopes observing some of the most 
extreme sources in the universe: violent stellar explosions, matter 
falling into black holes, and rapidly spinning neutron stars. Among 
all the variations of brightness we can study in these sources, 
periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations are among the most interesting, 
because they can often be directly tied to astrophysical processes in 
the object. Finding them in practice can be difficult, and the methods 
currently implemented in stingray have serious limitations that are 
often not met by the data we observe. Recently, Huebner et al 
(2022, arXiv:2205.12716) proposed a new method for searching for 
quasi-periodic oscillations, including an associated software tool 
(https://github.com/MoritzThomasHuebner/QPOEstimation). While it 
works, it is somewhat unwieldy, not well documented, and not well 
integrated with existing functionality in stingray. In this project, 
we will simplify the existing code, port it to the tinygp library, 
integrate it with stingray in a new submodule, and release it together 
with a tutorial.</p>
