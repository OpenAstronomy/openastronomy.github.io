<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The RADIS code was developed for the characterization of plasmas, flames and atmospheres. High-temperature spectral calculations require to resolve the shape of tens of millions of lines, which is the usual performance bottleneck. RADIS implements a new algorithm to compute these lineshapes, and is already one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available. It can also compute many different types of spectra (absorption / emission / equilibrium / nonequilibrium).</p>

<p>However, although the algorithm is very CPU/GPU efficient, the RADIS code is still memory-hungry. Databases are currently loaded in RADIS using the VAEX package, but the operations to calculate the spectra are performed using the PANDAS library.  VAEX is a similar table management tool than PANDAS but uses memory mapping, a zero memory copy policy, and lazy computations for the best performance. <strong>The main goal of the current project is to refactor RADIS so that dataframes are only manipulated via the VAEX format</strong>. Potentially, this work would make it possible to compute spectral databases of up to billions of lines (hundred of GB or terabyte-scale databases).</p>
