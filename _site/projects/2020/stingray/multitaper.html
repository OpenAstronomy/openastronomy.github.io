<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Generating periodograms for astronomical data is the core task of Stingray. Because periodograms are often noisy, several methods to denoise periodograms exist in the literature, among them the multi-taper periodogram
Stingray aims to provide a comprehensive library of reliable, well-tested implementations of common algorithms for time series analysis in Astronomy. In this project, the student will add the multi-taper periodogram to the existing code base in order to allow astronomers build periodograms with better noise properties.</p>
