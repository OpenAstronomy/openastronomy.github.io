<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Null-geodesics is the path traced by light rays in 4-D space-time. We aim to calculate null geodesics around non-rotating (Schwarzschild) and rotating (Kerr) massive bodies given the initial conditions.</p>

<p>The project has roughly the following objectives :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calculating null trajectories around a rotating/non-rotating black hole.</li>
  <li>Use those trajectories to raytrace a bundle of photon rays, to visualize how space-time gets distorted in presence of black holes.</li>
  <li>Calculate redshifts in photon rays due to space-time curvature.</li>
  <li>Visualization of Keplerian disc/shell in around it.</li>
  <li>In short, we aim to replicate one of the few papers available with proper coding paradigms like OOPs, good documentation and unit tests.</li>
  <li>If required due to performance issues, python wrappers over native C/C++ have to be written.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project also aims at fixing the problem of natural units introduced due to the research papers and books and to give native support to MKS units.</p>

<h4 id="milestones-if-any">Milestones (if any)</h4>

<h5 id="coding-starts">Coding starts</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Engaged with the community and understand the motivation and challenges of
the project.</li>
  <li>Have set up a development environment and get familiar with einsteinpy dependencies.</li>
  <li>Have read relevant literature/codes required for the project.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="1st-evaluation">1st evaluation</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Null geodesic in Kerr space-time</li>
  <li>Null geodesic in Schwarzschild space-time (It can be implemented by creating a class inheriting from Kerr null geodesics and setting a=0. However, it would lead to unnecessary calculation and therefore, seperate Schwarzschild-Null class is necessary.)</li>
  <li>If possible, basic raytracing using the newly created classes.</li>
  <li>Have all code, tests and documentation in GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="2nd-evaluation">2nd evaluation</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Plotting class for both Kerr and Schwarzschild null geodesics.</li>
  <li>Improvement in raytracing, along with simulation of a photon sheet around a black hole.</li>
  <li>Calculation of redshifts along the null trajectory.</li>
  <li>Have all code, tests and documentation in GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="final">Final</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Good-enough implementation of any of the relavent papers.</li>
  <li>Complete any chores left out during the 1st and 2nd phase.</li>
  <li>Fix the Natural Units Problem in Kerr-Newman time-like geodesics.</li>
