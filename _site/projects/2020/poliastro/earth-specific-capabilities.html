<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>poliastro has lots of interesting features for users analyzing interplanetary trajectories, some
of which are only present in commercial-off-the-shelf alternatives, such as
predefined low-thrust guidance laws, flybys analysis, and more. In fact, the scope of poliastro
explicitly mentions interplanetary applications, and we started there because</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is fun</li>
  <li>There were scripts here and there, but some of them didnâ€™t work well for attractors other than the Earth</li>
  <li>We were too lazy to learn SPICE</li>
</ul>

<p>However, most potential poliastro users (including commercial companies) are interested in
Earth-bound trajectory analysis. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Launch windows and orbit injection</li>
  <li>Station-keeping and orbit correction maneuvers</li>
  <li>Precise propagation using high-order gravitational and atmospheric models</li>
  <li>Two-Line Element (TLE) usage</li>
  <li>Orbit determination</li>
  <li>Observation scheduling</li>
  <li>Groundtrack plotting</li>
  <li>And more!</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of the project is open-ended and involves improving poliastro for some or all of the above use cases.</p>
