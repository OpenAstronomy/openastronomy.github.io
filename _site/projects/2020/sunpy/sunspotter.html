<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Space weather studies Sun-Earth interaction events. One of these, is the effect
of solar flares have on our civilisation. The forecast of solar flares is not a
solved problem, and many approaches have been tried.
<a href="https://www.sunspotter.org/">Sunspotter</a> is a citizen science project that
asked volunteers to classify solar active regions by their complexity - as it’s
believed complexity has a direct relationship with their activity. With more
than 25,000 volunteers and millions of classifications produced, we’ve got a
<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1478972#.XI4YPqHgqr8">very nice dataset</a> that can be
used to train a neural network. The images used come from the <a href="http://soi.stanford.edu/science/obs_prog.html">MDI
instrument</a>, which is onboard of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory">SoHO</a> - the
NASA-ESA mission that’s been observing the sun for more than two decades.</p>

<p>This project will need to create components within SunPy that will interact with
other libraries (<a href="https://scikit-image.org/">scikit-image</a>,
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a>, etc.) to create such model.</p>

<p>Read more information at the <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/wiki/SOCIS-2019-Ideas-Information#space-weather-forecasting-using-machine-learning">wiki page</a>.
Though this idea is for SOCIS, <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/wiki/SOCIS-2019">same GSOC rules apply</a>.</p>

HELIO</a>.</li>
  <li>Implementation of a basic linear algebra model to understand the steps
needed for this problem</li>
  <li>Write up notebook for the sunpy gallery that exemplifies an analysis of this
dataset</li>
</ul>
