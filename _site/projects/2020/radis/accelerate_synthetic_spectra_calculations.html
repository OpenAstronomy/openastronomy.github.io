<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The presence and concentration of molecules in a gas can be measured by comparing absorption and emission experimental spectra to synthetic spectra. However, under high-temperature conditions, the synthetic spectra contain dozens of millions of lines. In any line-by-line code the bottleneck is the calculation of the lineshapes, which can require long computational times (up to several minutes).</p>

<p>The RADIS code was recently developed for the characterization of high-temperature infrared spectra in plasmas and flames. It uses a new approach to quickly calculate lineshapes of synthetic spectra. The latest developments already make it one the fastest spectral codes in the world. The goal of this project is to push further and implement two new techniques to gain another orders of magnitude, by two means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementing GPU acceleration for lineshape calculation (proof-of-concept example has shown we can compute 250 millions lines in 150 ms!)</li>
  <li>Implementing a new vectorization technique to quickly compute lineshapes in line-of-sight spectra (i.e., a column of heterogeneous gas)</li>
</ul>

<p>This performance would be beneficial for new applications such as exoplanet characterization.</p>
