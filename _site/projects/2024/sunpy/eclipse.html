<h1 id="description">Description</h1>

<p>On April 8 2024, a total solar eclipse will will cross North America, passing over Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
It is expected that more than 20 million people will be able to witness it and we can expect a large number of amateur photographers to record the event.</p>

<p>Thus the purpose of this project is to develop tools to enable ground-based amateur photographs of the solar corona taken during the eclipse to be imported into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> and processed to enable comparison with space-based data sets already available in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> such as SDO/AIA.
Eclipse photographs also frequently require processing steps such as stacking and aligning of multiple exposures, sharpening, and flat-fielding.
This may require new algorithms to be developed or existing tools in SciPy or  other libraries to be identified and applied.</p>

<p>This project will need to create the components within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> but also other libraries such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunkit-image</code>.</p>

<p>There are several steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5073">Recreate this image.</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sunpy/solar-eclipse">Take the notebook and code from this repository</a> of a previous eclipse and update it work with the current version of sunpy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/7387">Add a new topic guide for the 2024 Eclipse</a>
This one has several smaller steps to break up the work.
    <ol>
      <li>A guide on how to import a photograph into a Map and determine its coordinates</li>
      <li>A guide on how to perform the following processing steps:
a. Stacking images with different exposure times
b. Flat-fielding
c. Sharpening</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note this will be a difficult project as we are dealing with solar coordinates and how to determine them from the Earth.
A background in Physics or Astronomy with experience of astropy or sunpy coordinates is preferred.</p>
