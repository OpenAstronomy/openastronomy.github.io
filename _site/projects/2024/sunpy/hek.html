<h1 id="description">Description</h1>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> provides access to solar feature and event data held by the <a href="https://www.lmsal.com/hek/">Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase</a>.
Descriptions of the properties of each feature and event are given <a href="https://www.lmsal.com/hek/VOEvent_Spec.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Feature and event properties include their type, physical extent, location, lifetime, and other feature/event properties that are specific to a given feature/event.
For example, the time at which the energy flux of a solar flare is at a maximum is relevant for flares, but is not relevant to the description of a coronal hole.</p>

<p>The current representation of HEK features/events in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> does not make full use of the capabilities of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> or the other libraries it uses.
For example, many feature/event properties are not expressed using Astropy units or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> coordinates, even although there is sufficient information in the HEK description that can be used to do this.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to create classes to represent HEK solar feature/events that function well within the SunPy ecosystem.
The design of the feature/event classes should be sufficiently general so as not to exclude their application to feature/event descriptions held by other catalogs.</p>

<p>A previous GSoC Project <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/7059">worked on this problem</a> and that will form the basis for this project.
This will shorten the project size and is why this is marked as a small project.</p>

<p>For this project, being familiar with astropy regions and some solar coordinate items would be ideal.</p>
