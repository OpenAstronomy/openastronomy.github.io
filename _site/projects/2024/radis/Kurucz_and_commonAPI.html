<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The RADIS code was developed for the characterization of plasmas, flames and atmospheres. High-temperature spectral calculations require to resolve the shape of tens of millions of lines, which is the usual performance bottleneck. RADIS implements a new algorithm to compute these lineshapes, and is already one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available. It can also compute many different types of spectra (absorption / emission / equilibrium / nonequilibrium). In a typical calculation, a database of coefficients is loaded and these coefficients are multiplied according to physics laws to generate a set of linestrength in a spectrum.</p>

<p>RADIS can handle different databases such as HITRAN, HITEMP, EXOMOL, GEISA, etc. Another open-source code, called EXOJAX, exchanged portions of code with RADIS until some parts of both codes became very similar. Currently, a database API is written in the RADIS code. The main goal of the current project is to add the atomic Kurucz database to RADIS. The second objective is to improve the aformentioned common API to download and manage all databases. The mentee will not start from scratch because the community already worked on the problem and set up a frame for this big merge of code built around a <a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/blob/develop/radis/api/dbmanager.py#L51">DatabaseManager</a> class. Previous work on the Kurucz database can be found in <a href="https://github.com/radis/radis/pull/601">this PR</a>.</p>
