<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Gnuastro is primarily written in C because astronomical datasets are large and thus need to be efficient with few dependencies.
Therefore, its most commonly used interface are Gnuastro’s command-line programs (that are built on the Unix philosophy).
However, Gnuastro’s also has an extensive set of installed, dynamic C/C++ libraries, which are the actually beating heart of the programs.
However, many projects today are done in Python, almost excuslively using Numpy for their numerical operations (like data arrays).
Python and Numpy are actually written in C, therefore they have very well-defined interfaces for communicating with installed C libraries.
Gnuastro therefore plans on adding a low-level wrapper infra-structure which will allow easy usage of Gnuastro’s powerful libraries in Python.
Note that this won’t involve intermediate wrapper languages SWIG, we will directly link with the core C library of Numpy: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/c-api.html
This will be a wonderful chance to master Python and Scipy/Numpy at a very fundamental level, giving you a great experience to expand what you have learnt afterwards into many other functionalities.
Of course, in the meantime you will also working on many real-world astronomical data and science scenarios using ground-based and space-based data.
