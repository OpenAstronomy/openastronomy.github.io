<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Astropy is a core python package for astronomy that provides several modules for the analysis of observational data. A common problem is storing and retrieving tabular data in standard formats which include metadata to fully describe the contents of a table. One such ASCII format is CDS (http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/doc/catstd.htx) that is used for publishing catalogues accompanying papers to astronomical databases like Vizier. Astropy has the capability of reading a CDS file to an astropy Table but not writing a Table to CDS. In this project, the student will create a CDS writer in astropy.io.ascii. A python module from CDS (https://github.com/cds-astro/cds.pyreadme/) uses astropy to write CDS files, and the astropy writer can be based on that.</p>
