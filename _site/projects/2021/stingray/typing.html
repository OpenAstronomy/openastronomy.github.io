<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Generating periodograms for astronomical data is the core task of Stingray. Because periodograms are often noisy, several methods to denoise periodograms exist in the literature, among them the multi-taper periodogram
Stingray aims to provide a comprehensive library of reliable, well-tested implementations of common algorithms for time series analysis in Astronomy. 
In this project, the student will introduce type hints in the code, in order to make debugging easier and, possibly, use runtime checks to ensure the consistency of results.</p>
