<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Stingray aims to provide a comprehensive library of reliable, well-tested implementations of common algorithms for time series analysis in Astronomy. Often, the ultimate goal of a researcher is statistical inference of some properties of an astronomical object. While stingray currently has an infrastructure for parametric modelling of Fourier products and light curves (based primarily on numpy and scipy), the existing infrastructure and algorithms are relatively fragile and tend to fail often.</p>

<p>In this project, the student will add automatic differentiation and modern optimization algorithms to make the existing infrastructure more robust. In a second step, the student will extend the existing infrastructure to facilitate building fully probabilistic models in TensorFlow Probability or PyMC3.</p>
