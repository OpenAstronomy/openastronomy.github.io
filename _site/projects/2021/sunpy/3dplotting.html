<p>The SunPy ecosystem currently has well developed support for making 2D plots (primarily with Matplotlib), but currently no interface for making 3D plots.</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>In this project the student will code new tools for taking common datasets used in the SunPy ecosystem (e.g. images of the Sun, maps of the Sun, magnetic field lines from models of the Sun), and plotting them in 3D. This will initially be done using the pyvista plotting toolkit, but we would like to make the tools general enough that other plotting toolkits (e.g. plotly) can be used too.</p>

<p>We have already trialled this, with some demo code at https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/4591. The goal of this project is to take this demo code, and put it in a new Python package to allow rapid development, independent of the sunpy core package. The work will be evenly split between writing new code, and learning how to write documentation and tests for the code within a package.</p>
