<p>This project will update the sunraster package to use the ndcube 2.0, a much more powerful version and lead to the next release of the sunraster package.</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The sunraster package provides tools for reading and manipulating satellite-based
observations from solar slit spectrometers such as NASA’s IRIS satellite
or SPICE onboard European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter satellite.
sunraster heavily leans on the ndcube package which provides powerful generic tools
for manipulating and inspecting n-dimensional astronomical data and
handling functional based coordinate transformations that describe the observations’
relationships to real world coordinates, e.g. which part of
the sky a camera pixel is pointing, or what time an image was taken.
These transformations are known as the World Coordinate System (WCS).</p>

<p>A new API-breaking version of ndcube (2.0) is imminent which supports a
more flexible generic API for WCS transformations.
This API is not backwards compatible and so requires upgrades to the sunraster
so users of solar spectrograph observations can more easily perform their
data analysis.</p>
