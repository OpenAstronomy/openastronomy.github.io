<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>This project will provide a new functionality to the ndcube package,
namely resampling data using the NDCube data class. The NDCube class 
enables users to manipulate and visualize n-dimensional astronomical data.
NDCube’s big advantage over arrays and other high-level data containers
is its support for functional coordinate transformations 
(World Coordinate System, or WCS) that enable users to easily track
what real world coordinates their data values correspond to.
For example, what point on the sky a pixel is pointing at.
NDCube has made coupling astronomical data and coordinate systems far more
user-friendly.  However the greatest outstanding functionality is
NDCube’s inability to resample its data onto a different pixel grid.
This would have many potenital benefits to users.
It would enable them to align data from different imagers onto the same
pixel grid, average their data over an axis, or sum their data onto
a coarser pixel grid to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and hence
better identify features in their data.
One of the things that makes this functionality non-trivial is
the requirement of altering the WCS transformations.
However, if users are able to resample their data with a single command
and have their coordinate transformations automatically update accordingly,
it would greatly speed up data analysis workflows and make such
analysis less prone to errors. 
Therefore this project will be of great benefit to the wider astronomical
community.</p>
