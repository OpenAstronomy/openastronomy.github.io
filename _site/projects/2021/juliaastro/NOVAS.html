<p>Implement a Julia version of the U.S. Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry 
Software (NOVAS) library and vectorize it to improve performance.</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The U.S. Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software (NOVAS) library
is used to accurately calculate the positions of celestial objects,
such as stars and planets. The software is used in the calculations of
the annual Astronomical Almanac, which is published by the U.S. Naval
Observatory and Her Majestyâ€™s Nautical Almanac Office. These
algorithms are used by astronomers for precision astrometry. In this
project, the student will implement a Julia version of the software
with modifications for ease of use and improved performance. A key
improvement with be to vectorize many of the algorithms so that they
can be used to quickly calculate the positions of tens of millions of
stars. The current C and FORTRAN versions do not have this feature.</p>
