<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The RADIS code was developed to characterize the radiation of plasmas, flames and atmospheres. It calculates high-temperature infrared spectra from databases of tens of millions of lines, with a new algorithm that already makes it one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available.</p>

<p>An experimental spectrum is compared to calculated spectra until a good match is obtained : then, the experimental temperature is known. 
The efficiency of the fitting process depends on the RADIS calculation times as well as the fitting algorithm used.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to compare and improve fitting algorithms to reduce the fitting time.</p>
