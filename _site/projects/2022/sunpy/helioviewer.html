<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>This project aims to design and implement a low level Python wrapper around the unirest API provided by the HelioViewer Project.
This would create a new affiliated SunPy package (name up for suggestions).
The benefit of this project is two-fold: firstly, SunPy is no longer responsible for maintaining the interface to the Helioviewer API, and secondly, the Helioviewer Project can add new Python-based capabilities as the API becomes available.</p>

<p>Currently <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HelioviewerClient</code> that implements only a handful of the available API.
They are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getClosestImage</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getJP2Image</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getJP2Header</code> (in an open pull request as of writing) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">takeScreenshot</code> from the Helioviewer API as <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/master/sunpy/net/helioviewer.py">currently implemented</a>.</p>

<p>What we want to do is to create a new Python package that will lightly wrap every aspect of the HelioViewer
API allowing anyone to create their own helioviewer.org like GUI in Python (this could be part of the project
but will depend on the progress).
To facilitate this, we will need to remove the current code from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> and move it to the new affiliated package.</p>

<p>Finally, we will then create a new client that interfaces with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy</code> downloader Fido.</p>
