<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>In a previous GSoC project, we replaced the way we build the sunpy.org website and the theme it used.
We now use sphinx to create both our website and documentation, using the <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-sphinx-theme">sunpy theme</a>.
This theme is based upon <a href="https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme">Sphinx Bootstrap theme</a> and it has served us very well. The problem is that it has been updated to bootstrap 4 and we would like to use that to improve the way our website and documentation render on smaller screens.
The main aim is to move our theme to use a new <a href="https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pydata’s base theme</a>. This gives us a new layout and more modern bootstrap versions.</p>

<p>The issue is that the way we have been using our theme has a few incompatibilities that either need patching to the pydata theme or overridden in our version.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A method to create the header bar to match how we currently do, see sunpy.org for an example.
    <ul>
      <li>We really like our dropdowns</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A method to anchor the footer bar instead of having it scroll.
    <ul>
      <li>Pydata’s will only show it when you scroll to the very bottom.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If there is time left over, we will then work through the remaining issues we have in our theme repository once the groundwork has been finished.</p>
