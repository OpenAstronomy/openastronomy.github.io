<p>This project will provide the ability to parse URL information in a programmatic way.</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>sunpy provides a way for users to access data using Fido and its many internal clients.
Many of these simpler clients do URL scraping to return metadata and data files to a user.</p>

<p>This scraping is done by the <a href="https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/api/sunpy.net.scraper.Scraper.html?highlight=scraper">scraper class</a>.
Over the years, the scale of what this class has to do has expanded to a point where it has become unmaintainable.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a new scraper with a predefined API and class structure.
Please be aware that this project is not a design project, the API and the scope of scraper has been predetermined and laid out by the GSoC mentors.
So the primary focus of this project will be to write the class and its methods to follow this specification (obviously leaving the implementation details mainly up to you).</p>

<p>There are more technical details on the linked issue.</p>
