<p>Bayesian Excess Variance (bexvar) in Stingray</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The Bayesian Excess Variance is a statistical measurement of variability 
in Poisson-distributed (e.g. X-ray or gamma-ray) data.
The time series from most astronomical facilities, and in particular from 
low-Earth orbit satellites, can only be recorded when the source is visible, 
most of all when it is not below the horizon (or in “Earth occultation” in the 
case of satellites).
The missing data from the occultation periods can result in spurious variability
if not properly accounted for.
Another possible source of spurious variability is the presence of variable 
background signals.
The Bayesian Excess Variance method is suitable for finding variability in 
gappy X-ray light curves with variable background.
The contributor will work to implement this method in Stingray, a Python library
for the analysis of astronomical time series.
