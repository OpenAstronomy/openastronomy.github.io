<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Astrometry is a critical component in the processing of astronomical data.
In short, astrometry is the process of finding the transformation matrix (including distortions) to convert pixel coordinates in one image into sky coordinates (usually RA and Dec).
Gnuastro’s astrometry library aims to be fully blind, needing no prior information on the input image’s location in the sky, or the optical distortion of the camera that has taken the image.
Many of the low-level components of astrometry have already been added in Gnuastro’s new implementation.
In particular, as part of GSoC 2021, we can now successfully find the linear parameters of Astrometry.
However, there are also non-linear (distortion) terms that need to be calculated.</p>
