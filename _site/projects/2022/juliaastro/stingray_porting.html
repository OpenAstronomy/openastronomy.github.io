<p>Spectral timing in Julia</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The analysis of time series from astronomical observations in the X-rays is an 
excellent tool to test advanced physical theories.
Of particular interest are the periodicities that are often observed in the 
X-ray signals coming from the surroundings of accreting black holes, and the
evolution of the rotation period of neutron stars.
The essential toolbox for X-ray timing analysis includes different kinds of 
periodograms, cross spectra, and a number of “variability vs energy spectra”, that
allow to understand the variability at different energies.
This project is about the implementation of a basic set of X-ray timing analysis 
operations in Julia, starting from the porting of the core operations from the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stingray</code> Python package.</p>
