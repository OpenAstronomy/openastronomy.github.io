<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>poliastro is already a useful tool for people with Python knowledge who know how to use a third party
library. However, to reach a wider range of users we should be able to create web applications
that use poliastro in the backend, and make this process as easy and cheap as possible.</p>

<p>There have been several ideas to create web applications using poliastro, but one potential
limitation has been the installation itself. poliastro dependencies are complex and somewhat
heavy, and there is also dependence on external data for things like planetary ephemerides.
This sole thing prevents the deployment of poliastro in services like Amazon Web Services Lambda,
as evidenced in <a href="https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/444">the issue #444</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of the project would be to make a slimmer or lighter version of poliastro by declaring
some dependencies optional, creating recipes to deploy poliastro in cloud services and PaaS
(Amazon, Google, Heroku) using open standards (Docker, Kubernetes), actually deploy it,
and if time permits create a demo REST API.</p>
