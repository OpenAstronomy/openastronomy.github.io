<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Since 2017 <a href="http://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/examples/Plotting%20in%203D.html">poliastro features 3d plotting using Plotly</a>.
However, it would be nice to use other popular orbit visualization solutions
such as Cesium.js. Although it is meant to create visualizations for Earth
orbits, there are ways to extend it to visualize interplanetary maneuvers,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cesium-dev/_zKyk0fRd-g/oTpRyuo8BgAJ">as the developers explained</a>.</p>

<p>Cesium.js uses a JSON format called CZML, and this project aims to add
support for CZML export for poliastro <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Orbit</code> objects. For that, the
sampling capabilities have to be improved and the tricks described above
have to be implemented, along with the creation of a Cesium app that can
understand our output.</p>
