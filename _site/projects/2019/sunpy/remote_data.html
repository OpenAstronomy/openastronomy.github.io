<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Some functionality in SunPy or in affiliated packages is going to need access to
data files on remote (HTTP) servers. Examples of this include data provided by
instrument teams relating to the calibrations or performance of the instruments,
these kind of data are highly likely to change with time.</p>

<p>This project needs to be designed and implemented under the assumptions that
SunPy has no control over the data on these servers, and that files on the
servers may be replaced with different files with the same name. This
functionality will therefore have to validate the retrieved files have the
expected hashes, while providing ways for users to override this hash if they
are aware of changes on the remote server.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/1939">issue #1939</a> for more details.</p>
