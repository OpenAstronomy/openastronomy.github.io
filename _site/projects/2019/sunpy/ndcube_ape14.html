<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>ndcube is a SunPy-affiliated package for generalized handling,
manipulating and visualizing N-dimensional astronomical data.  The
translations between the array indices and the real world coordinates
is described by the FITS-standard World Coordinate System (FITS-WCS).
However, other WCS frameworks exist such as generalized WCS (gWCS)
developed by astropy which will be used by missions like DKIST and
JWST.</p>

<p>In order to support both FITS-WCS and gWCS and hence support more
future and current missions, this project aims to convert the ndcube
package to a common WCS API.  The new API has already been outlined by
astropyâ€™s <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1188875#.XBE3S1JRcWo">APE 14</a>. Implementing support
for APE 14 will enable ndcube to use FITS-WCS and gWCS agnostically
and hence increase the power and scope of the ndcube package.  With
this new feature ndcube will become better placed to serve a wider
array of n-dimensional data analysis needs from multiple astronomical
communities.</p>

<h4 id="expected-outcomes">Expected Outcomes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Replace usage in NDCube of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.wcs</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pixel_to_world</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.world_to_pixel</code>
methods with APE 14 API.</li>
  <li>Replace implementation <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NDCube.world_axis_physical_types</code> with that
of APE 14</li>
  <li>Generalize slicing of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NDCube.wcs</code> attribute so that it works
for both FITS-WCS and gWCS.</li>
  <li>Reimplement the ndcube visualization mixins to use APE 14.</li>
</ul>
