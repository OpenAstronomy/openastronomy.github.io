<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The Sun displays many different features and events (FEs).  These are
detected and described either automatically by algorithm, or by visual
inspection by human, or by a combination of both.  There are many
different repositories of these FEs online.  SunPy provides access to
two large FE repositories, the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK) and
the Helio Event Catalogue (HEC).</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to create a SunPy object that normalizes
input from both the HEK and HEC and creates a SunPy FE object.  The
SunPy FE object should take advantage of existing SunPy capabilities
such as SunPy spatial co-ordinates and SunPy time.  This will make FE
data much more useful to SunPy users.</p>

<p>The SunPy FE object should interact intuitively with existing SunPy
objects such as the SunPy maps and timeseries.  For example, it should
be simple for a FE with a spatial extent property to be overplotted
on SunPy map; similarly, it should be simple for a FE with a temporal
duration to be overplotted on a SunPy timeseries.</p>
