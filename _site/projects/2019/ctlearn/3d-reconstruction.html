<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>One of the main goals of CTLearn is developing and implementing methods to perform classification/regression on <strong>multiple images simultaneously</strong>. Most ground-based imaging air Cherenkov telescope (IACT) experiments use an array of multiple telescopes to image each shower stereoscopically. Stereo imaging is the main reason for the breakthrough of ground based gamma-ray astronomy a decade ago, making it possible to achieve a better shower reconstruction, in particular the reconstruction of arrival direction.</p>

<p>When it comes to event reconstruction with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it likely that in order to improve noticeably on existing reconstruction methods, it will be necessary for CNN-based methods to make full use of this stereo information. The current methods implemented in CTLearn, like the convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) model do not take full advantage of this information, as they handle each input image of an event without any explicit reference to the geometrical relationship between all of the images.</p>

<p>The idea behind this project is to implement a pre-processing stage which does a preliminary geometric reconstruction before passing the data to a CNN. A purely geometric method, based on photon back-tracing coupled with information about the telescope positions and pointings, is used to reconstruct a 3D array input representing the shower. In this 3D array, unlike the original images (which is only a projection of the 3D shower onto the camera), locality is preserved, as information about the same part of the shower (in three dimensions) will be combined from all telescopes. Ideally, this should result in the locality and hierarchicality assumptions of CNNs being better satisfied, the CNN being better able to extract and use low-level shower information/features, and a more powerful classifier.</p>
