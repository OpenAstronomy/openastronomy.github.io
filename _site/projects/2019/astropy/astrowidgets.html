<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The goal of this project is to further develop a set of astronomical image <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets">widgets</a> allowing easy use of functionality from astropy and its affiliated packages in <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebooks. Preliminary work on this has begun in the <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astrowidgets">astrowidgets</a> package.</p>

<p>The final deliverable for the project will be a version of the <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astrowidgets">astrowidgets</a> package ready for release.</p>

<p>Some of the deliverables for this project would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development of the remaining unimplemented features in the
<a href="https://github.com/eteq/nb-astroimage-api">target API</a> using ginga as the backend.</li>
  <li>Develop an implementation using <a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot">bqplot</a> and
the <a href="https://github.com/glue-viz/ipyastroimage">ipyastroimage</a> mark for
<a href="https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot">bqplot</a> as the backend.</li>
  <li>Explore development of a non-interactive version using matplotlib as the backend.
The non-interactive version would implement as much of the API as possible in a
non-interactive format.</li>
  <li>Develop a method for identifying the nearest point source to a click on an image
(very preliminary work on this is available) by combining the above with astropy
and its affiliated packages (particularly photutils).</li>
  <li>Documentation for the implemented backends.</li>
  <li>More extensive test suite.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, these Jupyter notebooks will be developed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sample notebooks demonstrating each of the back ends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Preliminary development of this project is already underway, so some of the specific deliverables might have changed by the beginning of the summer of code.</p>
