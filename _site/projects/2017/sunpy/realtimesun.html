<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The project requires the combination of multiple parts of the sunpy 
library to combine them all and together with a flask (or similar) application
to visualise real time and past images of the sun on a website.</p>

<p>The project should have three parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add missing data sources like <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/real-time-solar-wind">DISCOVR</a></li>
  <li>Download, visualise (and probably annotate) and save real time data.</li>
  <li>Save these data and visualisations into a database containing metadata of these images.</li>
  <li>Create a web application that shows latest images and allows browsing and
querying the database for old images.</li>
</ul>
