<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) is a UV spectrograph
that observes the chromosphere and transition region of the Sun with
high spatial and time resolution to help reveal how the solar
atmosphere is energized. IRIS produces data through two instruments: a
slit-jaw imager which can take images of the Sun in various wavelength
bands; and a slit spectrograph which disperses the light through the
slit to produce 2D spectra (position along slit vs. wavelength). The
slit can be used in sit-and-stare mode (slit remains over the same
place on the Sun) or raster mode (sequentially scan the slit
perpendicular to its axis across a region on the Sun). This project
aims to introduce the capability to read in and analyze IRIS data
using SunPy. This includes the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Build upon pre-existing code in SunPy to develop an IRIS
MapSequence class so that slit-jaw images can be read in, combined
and analyzed in a convenient way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop and test an IRISRaster class to read in, combine and
analyze IRIS spectra from different raster positions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the two classes developed above, build an IRISObservation
container class to allow users to easily associate co-temporal
slit-jaw images and spectra.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Optional:</em> Although the IRIS instrument team has calibrated the
 publicly available IRIS data, finer tuning of this calibration can be
 helpful for advanced data analysis.  Tools to do this have been
 developed by the IRIS team in the Interactive Data Language (IDL),
 but no such tools exist in Python.  Depending on the progress and
 preference of the student, these tools can be developed in Python as
 part of this project.  This would include the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Develop and test a function for residual wavelength calibration.
This already exists in IDL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop and test a function to calculate the IRIS response
function.  This already exists in IDL but not Python.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the IRIS response function code, develop a function to
convert IRIS data into physical units.  This already exists in IDL
but not Python.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A good proposal would demonstrate that the student is familiar with
the Xarray package.</p>
