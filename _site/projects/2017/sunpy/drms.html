<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The SunPy JSOC client is a very rudimentary client to the
JSOCâ€™s <a href="http://jsoc.stanford.edu/ajax/exportdata.html">export data CGI</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/kbg/drms">drms</a> Python module is a more complete
implementation of the DRMS protocol. This project will involve contributions to
both drms and SunPy, to improve the drms library and integrate it into SunPy.</p>

<p>The drms module needs testing, and some other packaging improvements to
automatically run the tests. This might involve adoption of some of the Astropy
packaging code such as astropy_helpers, as agreed by the drms authors.</p>

<p>Once the drms package has been well tested, CI added and a conda package
created, the SunPy JSOC client could be improved and extended to enable use of
the majority of the drms functionality through the unified search API of SunPy.
While the SunPy implementation would not need to provide all the features of the
drms library, it would strive to provide a simple API for most queries supported
by drms. One high-priority feature that should be availble in SunPy is the
ability to query drms series for which the prime key is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T_REC</code>, also it
should be possible to download only the metadata from drms without downloading
the associated image data.</p>

<p>Finally, documentation in SunPy should be improved to detail much more of the
JSOC functionality. This should include API documentation, narrative
documentation in the guide and examples in the gallery.</p>
