<p>The SunPy <a href="http://sunpy.org">website</a> and the SunPy <a href="http://docs.sunpy.org">documentation</a> do
not have a consistent theme. This project would design a new look for both the
website and the documentation and then implement this as a general website theme
and as a sphinx theme for the documentation.</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>This project will design a new look for the SunPy website, and implement this as
a HTML/CSS theme which can be used by the current Jekyll website, and any future
technology used by the website.</p>

<p>Once this is done a sphinx theme will be developed that has the same design as
the SunPy website, and can be used by the main SunPy documentation and any SunPy
affiliated packages.</p>

<p>As extensions to this project any of the following things could be implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implement a registry of SunPy Affiliated packages on the website.</li>
  <li>Move away from Jekyll to a Python based static site generator. (Sphinx, Nikola, Pelican etc.)</li>
  <li>Write a sphinx extension that maintains an up to date list on the main website
of the instruments and data products supported by the sunpy library.</li>
  <li>Improve the content of the SunPy website.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this project is quite open to be customised in any proposal, a good proposal
will have taken the time to evaluate what can be achieved within the time frame
of the project and which (if any) of the extensions are to be undertaken and why
those particular extensions were chosen. Also a good proposal will demonstrate
that the applicant has the design and web development experience to successfully
undertake the project to a high standard.</p>
