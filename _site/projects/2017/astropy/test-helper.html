<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Astropy’s test helper (inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">astropy.tests</code>) is very useful. There are some
packages that do not want to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">astropy-helpers</code> submodule nor Astropy’s
package template, but could use its test helper very much. It seems natural to
extract the test helper into a new package on its own, so any developer can take
advantage of its extra <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pytest</code> features (e.g., remote data, doctest, etc).
Currently, the test helper uses other utility functions from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">astropy.utils</code> and
Astropy logging. Ideally, this new package would be a complete standalone. This
project would be to explore ways to re-package Astropy test helper as a
standalone package that is not dependent on Astropy, and make it happen.</p>
