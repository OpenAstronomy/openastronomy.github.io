<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The coordinates subpackage currently only supports transforming positional coordinates, but it would be useful to develop a consistent framework for also transforming velocities (e.g., proper motion to proper motion, or proper motion to cartesian) with full support for barycentric, galactocentric, and LSR motion. This project could be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>working with us to develop a consistent API for handling velocities within coordinates</li>
  <li>developing a trial implementation of an API</li>
  <li>actually doing core development to implement the new features</li>
  <li>some combination of all of the above.</li>
</ol>
