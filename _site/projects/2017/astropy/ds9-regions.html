<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>ds9 region files are the de facto standard way to specify regions on the sky for
many astronomers. The <a href="https://github.com/astropy/regions">regions</a> package has
been developed to replace the
dated <a href="https://github.com/astropy/pyregion">pyregion</a> module. To complete the
transition, we need a fully operational ds9 reader/writer system, including
appropriate metadata. This project will largely entail writing and modifying a
parser and producing the appropriate associated tests. If there is time, a CASA
regions reader/writer will also be developed.</p>
