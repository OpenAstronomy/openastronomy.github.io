<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Python-casacore is a set of Python bindings for [casacore] (https://github.com/casacore/casacore), a c++ library used in radio astronomy. This python binding to casacore is now python 3 compatible, contains some unit tests, etc. But some work remains to be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove all compile warnings</li>
  <li>Modernise code, add missing features, maybe more ‘pythonic’.</li>
  <li>Improve test coverage (24% at the moment)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a typical project to learn making good code.</p>
