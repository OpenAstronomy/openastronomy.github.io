<p>Design and Implement landing page for Astropy Learn ecosystem.</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>This project is for the creation of a landing web page for the Astropy Learn ecosystem.  The Learn ecosystems includes the Astropy documentation and associated examples, the Astropy tutorials, and guides (e.g., worked out science use cases). Implementing this likely also requires harmonizing the existing tutorials web site with the astropy documentation (which is generated by Sphinx).  This project may also include indexing/tagging of the materials and searching for content (this is already possible to some extent, but the current capabilities are inadequate).</p>
