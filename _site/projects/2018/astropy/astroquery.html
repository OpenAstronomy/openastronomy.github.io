<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p><a href="http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/">astroquery</a>, an astropy
affiliated package, is a package to place modules that access astronomical data
that is online. The aim of this project will be to implement just such modules,
for a variety of astronomical archives that are currently lacking astroquery modules.
A full list of new services that have been suggested by our users
<a href="https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22New+Service%22">can be found in these issues</a>,
and a summary <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/issues/226">in this issue</a>.</p>

<p>A <em>possible</em> set of milestones for any particular one of these modules  might be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Research the web API for the archive sufficiently to determine what exactly astroquery should expose.</li>
  <li>Determine the best interface to access the simplest subset of that archive that would be useful.</li>
  <li>Create an astroquery module to actually implement that interface.</li>
  <li>Add tests to ensure the module works correctly.</li>
  <li>Generalize that architecture to extend to other data products from the archive - e.g. repeat 1-4 until all useful functionality in the module is complete.</li>
</ol>
