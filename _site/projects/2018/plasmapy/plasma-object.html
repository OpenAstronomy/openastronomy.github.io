<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Plasma physics is an important and wide-ranging field of research with applications from astrophysics to fusion power, and PlasmaPy is a Python package which provides aims to provide tools for this research.
Currently PlasmaPy uses a single basic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Plasma</code> class to represent plasmas.
This class works well enough for the moment, but lacks a significant amount of flexibility that will be needed as PlasmaPy grows.
Given the broad purview of plasma physics, PlasmaPy will need to be able to handle observational data, simulation results and theoretical plasmas, but should ideally provide a single user experience for working with any of these.</p>

<p>The aim of this project would therefore be to implement a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Plasma</code> metaclass and a number of subclasses, similar to SunPyâ€™s use of <a href="http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/code_ref/map.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Map</code>s</a> for solar observations from different instruments.
These subclasses would handle respresenting and storing different kinds of plasmas using appropriate structures; for instance a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yt</code> data object would be ideal for 3D simulation data but not for a 1D observational timeseries.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Plasma</code> metaclass itself would create the appropriate subclass when instantiated, and provide a single data-agnostic user interface.</p>
