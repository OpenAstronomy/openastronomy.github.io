<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>One of the focuses of poliastro is having an easy to use API. That’s why,
for instance, when mixing quantities in meters and kilometers, poliastro
knows how to combine them in a proper way, thanks to astropy.units.
However, we haven’t reached this level of easiness with reference frames
yet: the frame is not part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Orbit</code> object, and mixing two orbits
can therefore produce meaningless or absurd results, in the same way
that mixing quantities in meters and kilometers can produce incorrect
results if not done carefully.</p>

<p>This project aims to resolve this difficulty by incorporating reference
frames to poliastro <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Orbit</code> objects. astropy already has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SkyCoord</code>
objects that contain all the necessary information, but it’s not clear
how to leverage them from poliastro (see
<a href="https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/257">the relevant discussion</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, validating all these algorithms cannot be done using
textbook examples anymore and more complex strategies have to be found,
for instance using the SPICE toolkit by NASA. Check out
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Juanlu001/3ba5f97928da923889b4201a94d1daa0">the example on how to run it from Python using the third party library SpiceyPy</a>.</p>
