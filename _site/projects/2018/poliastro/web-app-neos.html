<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Since 2017 poliastro features Near Earth Objects (NEOs) data
retrieval and 3D plotting, as can be seen in these notebooks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/examples/Using%20NEOS%20package.html">Using the NEOs package</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/examples/Plotting%20in%203D.html">Plotting in 3D</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With the increasing interest in NEOs it would be
interesting to offer the casual user a web application to visualize
the orbits of such objects to have a better idea on the magnitude of the
distances, the shape of the orbits and so on.</p>

<p>This project aims to provide such a web application so the user doesnâ€™t
have to set up a Python development environment, install poliastro,
launch a notebook, retrieve the data and visualize the orbits. Therefore,
the app should have an attractive user interface that lets the user
select NEOs from a list, possibly offering a list of famous examples
or recent approaches, move backwards and forwards in time, let them share
the configuration via copy-pasting URLs and exporting the results as
static plots or Python scripts.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that poliastro already uses Plotly to display 3D orbits,
the most natural choice for a web app would be <a href="https://plot.ly/dash/">Dash</a>,
which recently became a NumFOCUS affiliated project.</p>
