<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>The problem of propagation, finding the position and velocity of an orbiting
object after some amount of time, is fundamental to any orbit analysis.
It is a difficult problem, since the Kepler equation is transcendental and
does not have a closed-form solution, and therefore numerical solutions
have to be developed. The process has to be both fast (since a program
might need to propagate thousands of orbits) and robust (converge in as
many cases as possible).</p>

<p>In poliastro we already have a propagator that has served us well for years, but
<a href="https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/265">it has some convergence problems</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, among the many propagation algorithms that exist,
we havenâ€™t benchmarked our propagator against others, so we might be missing
out performance gains. This project aims to fix the current propagation
issues, as well as adding other propagators to poliastro to let users
choose the best that suits their needs.</p>
