<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>This is a code performance project for
<a href="https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray">Stingray</a> with the aim of
handling large datasets (more than 1 million photons) that do not fit into
memory (such as from <a href="http://astrosat.iucaa.in/?q=node/12">AstroSat</a> and
<a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/">NICER</a>). The student will
go through GitHub issues to see where Stingray workflows are breaking down in
practical use cases, make a thorough profiling of the code, single out
bottlenecks, and find solutions.</p>

<h4 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h4>
<p>Deliverables for this project will be profiling and developing solutions for
code bottlenecks and other hindrances to using Stingray library tools on large
datasets.</p>
