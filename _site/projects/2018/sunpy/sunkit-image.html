<p>In this project you would create the foundations of the ‘sunkit-image’ SunPy
affiliated package, a package to contain image processing routines and
functionality specific to the analysis of solar physics data.</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>There have been various proposals for adding image processing and manipulation
code to the SunPy library. SunPy has decided that this functionality will
instead reside in an affiliated package, named ‘sunkit-image’. This
project will setup this package and implement the initial functionality.</p>

<p>There is various functionality that should be added to ‘sunkit-image’ some of it
already developed, some of it not. This project should achieve some or all of
the following goals (roughly in this order):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Implement the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006SoPh..236..263M">normalizing-radial-graded filter (NRGF)</a>.</li>
  <li>Port the Multi-Scale Gaussian Normalisation (MGN) code from <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1899">#1899</a>.</li>
  <li>Implement the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5046">OCCULT-2 algorithm</a> for coronal loop tracing.</li>
  <li>Implement image re-sampling as described <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/B:SOLA.0000021743.24248.b0.pdf">here</a> through updating <a href="https://github.com/astropy/reproject/pull/52">this pull request</a> to the Astropy <a href="https://reproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">image resampling</a> repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>Optional extras:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Implement the <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2006/38/aa4852-06.pdf">soft morphological filtering of solar images</a></li>
  <li>Refactor and write a Python wrapper for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.4289">FLCT</a> <a href="http://solarmuri.ssl.berkeley.edu/overview/publicdownloads/software.html">code</a>.</li>
  <li>Implement image alignment using feature detection and tracking. <a href="http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_brief.html">Example</a></li>
</ol>
