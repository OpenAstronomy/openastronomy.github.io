<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>SunPy currently uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datetime.datetime</code> objects as itâ€™s internal representation
of time. The goal of this project is to transition every part of the SunPy
codebase to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">astropy.time.Time</code> instead. The main motivation for this is
that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Time</code> object in Astropy supports much higher precision representations
of time as well as supporting time formats <em>e.g.</em> TAI time which are commonly
used by solar physicists.</p>

<p>This transition is a major component of the planned SunPy 1.0 release, and will
involve many changes to a lot of the SunPy library, and some design and user
experience work to plan the project and ensure its success.</p>

<p>As well as changing the internal representation of time in the SunPy library,
this project will involve rewriting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sunpy.time.parse_time</code> function. This
function is used to convert any supported time input to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datetime.datetime</code>
objects, and is used in most SunPy functions that accept time-like inputs. This
function is also one of the oldest in SunPy, and in need of a redesign to go
with the transition to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">astropy.time.Time</code>. A successful candidate for this
project will have done substantial research on the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parse_time</code> in the
SunPy code and will appreciate the requirements for changes to this part of
SunPy.</p>
