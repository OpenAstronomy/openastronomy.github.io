Other than the [requirements from Google](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) you will have to meet the following:

* You have to read carefully and follow [our student guide ](/gsoc/student_guidelines.html)
* You have submitted some code sample via pull-request to the sub-organisation
you are applying. (Read the developer guides to do it properly and look for
issues labelled `package-novice` for an easier start).
* You will need to create a blog to keep it up to date during the programme. You can start
writing about how you found us, the issue you are working on and how you find the community.
