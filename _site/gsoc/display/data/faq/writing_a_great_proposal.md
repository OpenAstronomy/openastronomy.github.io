Having a very good proposal is not that difficult, but you will have to
invest time on writing it.

You need start by understanding how the sub-organisation you want to work with works,
read all their user and developers guide. Look then at the project idea you like the
most and find all the issues related to that particular project.

What's the final goal of that project? Can you break it in sub-projects? Can
you estimate how long these sub-projects are going to take you? The best applications
we've had contains a list of problems to solve on a weekly basis.
But... _The best laid plans of mice and men gang oft astray_, sure! you will encounter
problems on the way, but having a plan will help you to prioritise when stuck. And of
course, your mentors will help you too.

Don't forget that a submission of new code is not only code, but its documentation and
tests!

Use the wiki of each sub-organisation and the "draft" feature on the GSoC
system early on, so you can get comments and feedback from the mentors and the rest of
the community.
